<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Dominic!</h1>

I'm a Second Year Computer Engineering Student @ UBC. Interested in virtual reality, computer systems, and any emerging technologies. When I'm not busy in school, I like to [3D model](https://www.artstation.com/dombo), go biking, and read up about any new innovations.

  ### ‚ú® Magic Mirror
  This is a project I completed in high school for a class, where I built a smart mirror using recycled parts, such as an old monitor, and spare lumber. Every part was already on hand, except for the sheet of mirror glass. The smart mirror uses [Magic Mirror 2](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror), an open-source program which allows you to create and configure your own, or other people's modules. The mirror is able to display reminders, Spotify, the news, compliments, and weather. It can be voice-controlled using a voice assistant (Google Home, Amazon Alexa) to add reminders. The mirror can be connected to another computer using [DWService](https://github.com/dwservice/agent).
  
  ### ‚òÅÔ∏è Self-Hosting Nextcloud Cloud
  Not wanting to pay money for cloud storage, I looked into self-hosting my own cloud, not only to save money but as an opportunity to learn. Running on an old computer repurposed as a server PC operating on Ubuntu Linux, the computer runs [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud), a free and open-source cloud software.
  
  ### üíª [Mini Code Projects](https://github.com/itsdombo/MiniCodeProjects)
  This repository serves as a pastebin for me to organize and display any finished code projects I have done. These projects' scope is usually quite small, as the repository's name says. The purpose of doing this is to get familiar with any language that I am trying to learn by creating practical projects to gain a better understanding of the language.
  
  ### ü¶û Clawdius | UBC APSC 101
  A project that my group and I completed in first year, where we were tasked to create an autonomous claw. The design used a sonar sensor to detect when an object was in the claw's reach and picked it up.

  ### üêî [Cluck Guard](https://github.com/itsdombo/CluckGuard)
  A summer project of mine, Cluck Guard, is a low-cost, low-maintenance, and open-source alternative to other chicken doors on the market. Utilizing a pulley system, the door is lifted with a servo that rotates a pulley 360 degrees. The project has been sunsetted, but the code and demonstration can be viewed [here](https://github.com/itsdombo/CluckGuard)!

  ### üç∫ [UBC BIoT Instrumentation](https://www.ubcenvision.com/beer/)
  I'm the team captain (formerly instrumentation lead) for UBC BIoT (Brewing Internet of Things), where we use process control, thermodynamics, and kinetic modelling to control the desired outcome for fermenting beer. Big breweries are able to use sophisticated equipment, but homebrewers and small teams don‚Äôt have access to the same equipment. BIoT‚Äôs goal is to design low-cost data monitoring and research innovative techniques to brew high-quality beer. The team‚Äôs repository can be viewed [here](https://github.com/UBC-Brewing-Internet-of-Things).  

  ### üíª [dombo.me](https://dombo.me)
  My website, where I post my socials and projects. This is my first experience building a website. So far, it only uses HTML and CSS. Embracing the elegance of minimalism, I have deliberately created a minimalist design, paying homage to my appreciation for the beauty of simplicity in webpages.

  ### ü•ó Virtual Fridge (Code available upon request)
  A food management app that scans grocery receipts or barcodes, tracks expiry dates and sends reminders about soon-to-expire items. It also suggests recipes based on the ingredients in your fridge to help reduce food waste and save money, while making the user feel good about it with insights on how their efforts are saving them money and reducing emissions.
