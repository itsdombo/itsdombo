<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Dominic!</h1>

I'm a First Year Engineering student at UBC, who has an interest for virtual reality, computer systems, and any cool tech. When I'm not busy in school, I like to [3D model](https://www.artstation.com/dombo), and read up about what's happening in the world of tech.

  ### ‚ú® Magic Mirror
  This is a project I completed in highschool for a class, where I built a smart mirror using recycled parts, such as an old monitor, spare lumber. Every part was already on hand, except for the sheet of mirror glass. The smart mirror uses [Magic Mirror 2](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror), an open-source program which allows you to create and configure your own, or other peoples modules. The mirror is able to display reminders, spotify, the news, compliments, weather, and can be voice controlled using a voice assistant (Google Home, Amazon Alexa) to add reminders. The mirror can be connected to from another computer using [DWService](https://github.com/dwservice/agent).
  
  ### ‚òÅÔ∏è Self-Hosting Nextcloud Cloud
  Not wanting to pay money for cloud storage, I looked into self-hosting my own cloud, not only to save money, but as an opportunity to learn. Running on an old computer repurposed as a server PC operating on Ubuntu Linux, the computer runs [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud), a free and open source cloud software.
  
  ### üíª [Mini Code Projects](https://github.com/itsdombo/MiniCodeProjects)
  This repository serves as a little pastebin for me to organize and display any finished code projects I have done. The scope of these projects are usually quite mini, as the repository's name says. The purpose for doing this is to get familiar with any language that I am trying to learn by creating practical projects to gain a better understanding of the language.

  ### üç∫ [UBC BIoT Instrumentation](https://www.ubcenvision.com/beer/)
  I work on the instrumentation team for UBC BIoT (Brewing Internet of Things), where we use process control, thermodynamics, and kinetic modelling to control the desired outcome for fermenting beer. Big breweries are able to use sophisticated equipment, but homebrewers and small teams don‚Äôt have access to the same equipment. BIoT‚Äôs goal is to design low-cost data monitoring and research innovative techniques to brew high-quality beer. The team‚Äôs repository can be viewed [here](https://github.com/frehlid/BIOT-Instrumentation/).
